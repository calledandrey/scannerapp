            responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate
            the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for
            Scanner, we can stop providing all or part of the Service to you. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">General Conditions </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service
            for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. If we terminate your access to
            the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes,
            friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (eg, users will not be
            able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear
            within the Service (eg, if your Content has been reshared by others). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use
            will immediately cease. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use
            (&quot;Updated Terms&quot;) from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons,
            we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may
            notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the
            effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify)
            constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any
            Updated Terms </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of
            posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the
            Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective
            date of the Updated Terms. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any
            time. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or
            accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use. </span>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service,
            whether online or offline. You agree that Scanner is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any
            user. Scanner reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes
            between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,
            including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the
            Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features
            in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not
            control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including
            applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature.
            For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your
            Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party&#39;s service or application.
            Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you
            do so at your own risk. Scanner does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their
            content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Scanner is in no way responsible or liable for any
            such third- party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND
            THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute
            discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a
            third-party service (each, </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">an &quot;Application&quot;) and such Application may interact with, connect to or
            gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge
            and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to
            information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause
            personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Scanner
            has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and
            risk, and you will hold the Scanner Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the
            Application. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the
            Service. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the
            Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the
            result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Scanner&#39;s
            express consent). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Subscriptions </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
            (&ldquo;Subscription(s)&rdquo;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis
            (&ldquo;Billing Cycle&rdquo;). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the
            type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under
            the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Scanner cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
            renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Scanner customer support
            team. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal or to iTunes Account, is
            required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Scanner with accurate and
            complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
            payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Scanner
            to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours
            before the end of the current period. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current
            period, and identify the cost of the renewal </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Subscriptions and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after
            purchase </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Scanner will issue an
            electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
            payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Free Trial </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Scanner</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;may, at its sole discretion, offer a
            Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (&ldquo;Free Trial&rdquo;). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the
            Free Trial. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will
            not be charged by Scanner until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period,
            unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees
            for the type of Subscription you have selected. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">At any time and without notice, Scanner reserves the right to (i) modify the
            terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited when a subscription is purchased
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fee Changes </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Scanner</span><span class="c2">, in its sole discretion and at any time, may
            modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the
            end of the then- current Billing Cycle. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scanner will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
            Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
            effective. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
            constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rights </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Scanner</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;does not claim ownership of any Content
            that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Scanner a non- exclusive, fully

            or through the Service, subject to the Service&#39;s Privacy Policy, including but not limited to sections 3
            (&quot;Sharing of Your Information&quot;), 4 (&quot;How We Store Your Information&quot;), and 5 (&quot;Your

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display
            advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Scanner may place such advertising and
            promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of
            such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or
            commercial communications as such. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through
            the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use;
            (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or

            the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Service contains content owned or licensed by Scanner (&quot;Scanner
            Content&quot;). Scanner Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other
            laws, and, as between you and Scanner, Scanner owns and retains all rights in the Scanner
            Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or
            other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Scanner Content and you will not
            reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute,

            without prior written permission from Scanner. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although it is Scanner&#39;s intention for the Service to be available as much
            as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for
            scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links
            and/or equipment. Also, Scanner reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any
            reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Scanner,
            including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable
            without a valid court order. Consequently, Scanner encourages you to maintain your own backup of your
            Content. In other words, Scanner is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the
            Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Scanner will not be liable to you for any
            modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also
            acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You agree that Scanner is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content
            posted within the Service. Scanner do not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove
            any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that
            Content. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Except as otherwise described in the Service&#39;s Privacy Policy, as between you and
            Scanner, any Content will be non-confidential and non- proprietary and we will not be liable for any
            use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Scanner is not a
            confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content
            does not place Scanner in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the
            general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any
            obligation of confidence on the part of Scanner, and </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scanner will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">It is Scanner&#39;s policy not to accept or consider content, information,
            ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain
            specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas
            are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Scanner does not
            accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so
            transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or

            limitation, reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the
            following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your
            behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of
            these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any
            intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of
            any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and
            quasi-governmental authorities, including, </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or
            (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Scanner in the defense
            of any claim. Scanner reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
            subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written
            consent of Scanner. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arbitration </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Scanner&#39;s
            intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents)
            or (2) violations of provisions 2.13 or 2.14 of the Basic Terms, above (&quot;Excluded Disputes&quot;), you
            agree that all disputes between you and Scanner (whether or not such dispute involves a third party)
            with regard to your relationship with Scanner, including without limitation disputes related to these
            Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by
            binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&#39;s rules for arbitration of
            consumer-related disputes and you and Scanner hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative,
            you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims
            court&#39;s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Scanner will
            participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also
            agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or
            consolidated claims involving another person&#39;s account, if Scanner is a party to the proceeding.
            This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American
            Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days
            of filing the case, then either Scanner or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead
            by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
            entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the
            arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of
            Use. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor
            Scanner can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify
            Scanner in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration
            provision. You must use this address to opt out: </span><span class="c8">Scannerappnet@gmail.com</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c3"><span class="c7 c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your
            Scanner account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third
            parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration
            section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship
            with Scanner. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time Limitation on Claims </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship
            with Scanner must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently
            barred. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Governing Law &amp; Venue </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
            California, the United States of America, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND
            WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE
            OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision
            of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to
            resolve any dispute you have with Scanner exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa
            Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County
            for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any
            reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be
            deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any
            remaining provisions. Scanner&#39;s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any
            provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of
            these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or
            condition. Scanner reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes
            will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions
            with Scanner. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are
            authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the
            entire agreement between you and Scanner and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior
            agreements between you and Scanner. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or
            delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without
            the prior written consent of Scanner. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the
            appropriate prior written consent of Scanner will be null and void. Scanner may assign these Terms
            of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a
            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree
            that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full
            force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify
            the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. </span></p>
